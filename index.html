        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>Hello! My name is Robin Goodwin, and I'm enrolled in Western Washington University's Design Program. I was born in Memphis, TN, and I have been living in the Seattle area since I was about 19 years old. Currently, my partner, Ryan, and I are living in a small, detached apartment behind a duplex in Shoreline. My sister, Acacia, and my brother-in-law, Richard, live in one half of the duplex, while my mother occupies the other half of the duplex. It’s not as crappy as it sounds. When I’m not in school, I enjoy sleeping, napping, petting my cat (Macaroni), petting my mom’s cat (Jinx), interrupting Acacia’s Zoom meetings, spending time with Ryan, eating Indian food, hoarding art supplies, watching television, and sitting quietly. My favorite aspects of design include, but are not limited to: illustration, design and layout for print, and typography (even though I’m not very good at it).</p>
